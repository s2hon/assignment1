*Objectives*

Our assignment was to refractor the existing webpage code-for Horiseon-that follows accessibility standards so that their site site is optimized for search engines.

Some of the requirements were:

* code refractoring non-semantic HTML elements to semantic HTML elements
* a title element is concise and descriptive
* all image elements to have alt attributes
* heading attributes are in in sequential order
* make sure that all links are functioning correctly
* rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties
* organizing CSS to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
* including comments before each element or section of the page
